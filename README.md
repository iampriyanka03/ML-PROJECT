BULDHANA YIELD ESTIMATION
I  led a project on "Buldhana Yield Estimation," where the goal was to estimate crop yield in the Buldhana region. 

The project focused on predicting the dependent variable, experimental weight, using various independent variables.

The project followed a systematic approach:

Statistical Analysis: Initially, I conducted comprehensive statistical analyses to gain insights into the dataset.

Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to ensure data quality and reliability.

Data Preprocessing: I performed data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Feature Selection: Utilizing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, I identified highly correlated features to improve model performance.

Machine Learning Algorithms: I implemented various machine learning algorithms, both with and without cross-validation, to predict experimental weight accurately.
